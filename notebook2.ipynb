Apart from this, you should also know the inclusion and exclusion of the plan you are buying. Here are some ways by which you can compare two wheeler insurance plans:\\n\\n1. Premium Break-up: Always ask for a premium break-up of your two wheeler insurance policy. A clear break-up will help you get clear idea for what you are paying for.\\n\\n2. Own Damage Premium: Own damage bike insurance provides coverage if your bike is stolen or faces any other kind of damage due to an insurable peril. When you are checking the premium of own-damage, here are some of the things that you need to know about:\\n\\nâ€¢ IDV: IDV or Insured Declared Value refers to the market value of your bike. The IDV is directly proportional to the bike insurance premium, hence lower the IDV, lower will be the bike insurance premium.\\n\\nâ€¢ NCB: NCB or No Claim Bonus in bike insurance is the benefit given to the policyholder if they do not raise any claim in a given year. If a person has an accumulated NCB, then their bike insurance premium will be lower. However, it is important to renew your bike insurance plan within 90 days after its expiry to take advantage of NCB benefits\\n\\n3. Third-party Bike Insurance Premium: Third party bike insurance provides coverage for third party liabilities. Typically, third-party bike insurance provides a financial coverage of up to Rs. 1 lakh for any damage to third party property or person. In addition, there's unlimited coverage for the death or disability of another person involved in an accident by the insured person's vehicle. This amount is decided by court.\\n\\n4. Personal Accident Premium: In bike insurance, it is mandatory to have a Personal Accident Cover. This type of cover is only meant for the policyholder.

The comprehensive cover policy provides all round protection and provides coverage against theft, natural and man-made mishaps, and accidents along with third party damage.Considering the benefits it offers, the premium for a comprehensive cover will be more as compared to the premium for third party cover.\\n\\n2)Type and Condition of Two wheeler\\nDifferent bikes have different specifications and therefore, the cost of insuring them is also different. A bike engineâ€™s cubic capacity is the deciding component that affects the insurance premium. Higher the cubic capacity, higher will be the insurance premium. In addition, the age of the vehicle, type of bike model and class of the vehicle, place of registration, fuel type, and the number of miles covered also affect the premium price.\\n\\n3) Risk Evaluation Based on Driverâ€™s Record\\nNot many people are aware but your age, gender, driving record and driving experience can also affect the insurance premium. In such instances, companies calculate the associated risk factor and accordingly charge the premium. For example, a young driver (in the early 20s) with a year of driving experience will be charged a higher premium as compared to a middle-aged, experienced bike driver.\\n\\n4) Bikeâ€™s Market Value\\nThe current price or market value of the bike also affect the insurance premium. The market value of the bike depends upon its brand and functionality. If the vehicle is old, the premium is decided based on the condition of the vehicle as well as its resale value.\\n\\n5) Add-On Covers\\nAdd-on covers can help in increasing the coverage, but the more the number of add-ons, the higher will be the premium. Therefore, choose only those covers that you deem necessary.\\n\\n6) Modifications Done on Bike\\nMany people love adding accessories to their bikes in order to improve its aesthetics and performance. However, these modifications are usually not covered under the standard insurance policy and you might need to purchase an add-on cover for these modifications.

In addition, the age of the vehicle, type of bike model and class of the vehicle, place of registration, fuel type, and the number of miles covered also affect the premium price.\\n\\n3) Risk Evaluation Based on Driverâ€™s Record\\nNot many people are aware but your age, gender, driving record and driving experience can also affect the insurance premium. In such instances, companies calculate the associated risk factor and accordingly charge the premium. For example, a young driver (in the early 20s) with a year of driving experience will be charged a higher premium as compared to a middle-aged, experienced bike driver.\\n\\n4) Bikeâ€™s Market Value\\nThe current price or market value of the bike also affect the insurance premium. The market value of the bike depends upon its brand and functionality. If the vehicle is old, the premium is decided based on the condition of the vehicle as well as its resale value.\\n\\n5) Add-On Covers\\nAdd-on covers can help in increasing the coverage, but the more the number of add-ons, the higher will be the premium. Therefore, choose only those covers that you deem necessary.\\n\\n6) Modifications Done on Bike\\nMany people love adding accessories to their bikes in order to improve its aesthetics and performance. However, these modifications are usually not covered under the standard insurance policy and you might need to purchase an add-on cover for these modifications. However, adding these modifications under your insurance policy can increase the premium amount.\\n', 'chunkSeqId': 2, 'insurance_company': 'HDFC ERGO', 'insurance_type': 'two-wheeler-insurance', 'source': 'https://www.hdfcergo.com/two-wheeler-insurance', 'HeadLine': \"Factors affecting two-wheeler insurance premium include type of policy, bike specifications, driver's record, bike's market value, add-on covers, and modifications made on the bike.\", 'about': 'claim'}, {'text': 'how to Save on Bike Insurance Premium?\\nIn recent years the purchase of two wheeler insurance policy has shown a tremendous increase.

The bonus is a reduction in the bike insurance policy premium cost. Even though the bike's IDV decreases annually, the insurance price may increase due to economic inflation. This is why the policyholder would benefit much from even a minor premium cut.\\n\\nThe most significant advantage is that NCB enables you to obtain the same level of coverage for a significantly lesser price. It also motivates to keep the insurance from expiring between renewals.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is IDV in Two Wheeler Insurance?\\nIDV , or insured declared value in an insurance policy for bike, is the maximum sum for which your motorcycle may be covered by insurance. This is the insurance payout if the two wheeler is lost or stolen without a trace. In other words, the Insured Declared Value of your bike is its current market value.\\n\\nWhile the actual IDV of the bike is calculated using the formula published by the IRDAI, you would have the option to change the value by a 15% margin.\\n\\nYou would get a larger sum as compensation in the event of a total loss or theft if the insurer and the insured mutually agreed upon the higher IDV. Nevertheless, it would be best if you didn't arbitrarily raise the IDV because you would be paying a higher premium for nothing more.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you shouldn't reduce the IDV just to reduce the premiums. For starters, you would not receive adequate compensation for theft or total loss and would have to pay more out of pocket to obtain a replacement. Additionally, all claims will be honoured in proportion to the IDV.\\n\\n\\nFactors that Affect IDV of Your Bike:\\n1) Age of the bike:\\n    As your bike ages, its depreciation increases, so the IDV goes down. So, for older bikes, the IDV is lower than newer ones.\\n\\n2)The make, model and variant:\\nYour bike's make, model and variant (MMV) determines its market value. Different bikes are priced differently, and when you buy 2-wheeler insurance, the make and model of the bike are required to determine the IDV. Based on the MMV, the bike's market value is determined, and then the applicable depreciation is deducted to arrive at the IDV.\\n\\n3) Accessories added:\\nIf you add accessories to your bike, which are not factory fitted, the value of such accessories will be part of your IDV calculation. In such cases, IDV would be calculated using the following formula â€“ IDV = (market value of the bike â€“ age-based depreciation of the bike) + (market value of the accessories â€“ depreciation on such accessories)\\n\\n4) Registration date of your bike:\\nAs your bike ages, its depreciation increases and, so, the IDV goes down. Therefore, if the registration date of your bike is older, then the IDV will be less than the newer ones.\\n\\n5) Make & model of your bike:\\nYour bike's make, model and variant (MMV) decide its market value. Different bikes have different prices, so when you buy two wheeler insurance, the make and model of the bike are required to determine the IDV. Based on the MMV, the bike's market value is determined, and after deducting the applicable depreciation, we get the IDV.\\n\\n6) Other factors which play:\\n    an important role are\\n    â€¢ The city you registered your bike in\\n    â€¢ The type of fuel your bike consumes\\n\\n\", 'chunkSeqId': 3, 'insurance_company': 'HDFC ERGO', 'insurance_type': 'two-wheeler-insurance', 'source': 'https://www.hdfcergo.com/two-wheeler-insurance', 'HeadLine': 'No Claim Bonus (NCB) in Two Wheeler Insurance rewards safe driving with reduced premium costs, while Insured Declared Value (IDV) represents the maximum coverage amount for a bike in case of loss or theft, influenced by factors like age, make, model, accessories, and registration date.', 'about': 'feature'}, {'text': 'What is Zero Depreciation in Insurance for Bike?\\nDepreciation is the decrease in the value of your bike brought on by normal wear and tear over time.\\nOne of the most popular 2 wheeler insurance add -on covers is zero depreciation two wheeler insurance, sometimes called \"nil depreciation.\" With comprehensive bike insurance or a standalone own damage two wheeler insurance policy, Zero Depreciation add -on coverage is available.\\nAll your bikeâ€™s parts are insured at 100%, except the tyres, tubes, and batteries, which are covered at 50% depreciation.\\nYou must add a zero depreciation add-on cover to your basic bike insurance plan to receive the total bike insurance claim settlement amount without suffering any reductions.\\nWho should opt for the Zero Depreciation add-on coverage?\\nâ€¢ New motorists\\nâ€¢ New owners of two wheelers\\nâ€¢ People who reside in accident-prone regions\\nâ€¢ People who own expensively equipped luxury two wheeler\\n', 'chunkSeqId': 4, 'insurance_company': 'HDFC ERGO', 'insurance_type': 'two-wheeler-insurance', 'source': 'https://www.hdfcergo.com/two-wheeler-insurance', 'HeadLine': 'Zero Depreciation in Bike Insurance ensures that all parts of your bike are covered at 100% without depreciation, making it ideal for new bike owners or those with expensive luxury bikes.', 'about': 'feature'}, {'text': 'Types of Bike Insurance Plan by HDFC ERGO:\\n\\nHDFC Ergo offers 4 types of two wheeler insurance like Comprehensive insurance,Third Party insurance, and Standalone own damage car, and cover for a brand new bike.
